                "explanation": "You might have noticed that there are multiple ways to use Sveiki. <br>That is because you can use it differently, depending on what gender the person you're speaking to is. <br>Every noun has either a male or female gender and every gender has many word endings, but the most common are:<br>'a','ė' for female (mam<b>a</b>-mum) and <br>'as', 'is' for male (stal<b>as</b>-table)"

                "explanation": "Every noun, verb or adjective, in Lithuanian, has a different ending depending on it's plurality. <br>For example, 2 small tables would translate to <br>2 maži stalai, whereas one small table is <br>1 mažas stalas<br> (Notice the different endings)<br>Plural is also used to approach someone you don't know or someone you respect, <br>e.g. Sveiki, broli (Hello, brother)"
